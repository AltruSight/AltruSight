## Project Goals ##
AltruSightâ€™s goal is to implement a proof-of concept website to serve as a beacon of transparency when it comes to donating money to nonprofits. There are several main goals for our project. First, we want to provide a centralized system where donors can track how their donations are being used. We also wish to add a social aspect of donation in the form of a Venmo-esque payment feed, as well as the ability to favorite, share, like, etc. for any nonprofit supported on the website. We also wish to ultimately provide a comprehensive analytics platform detailing how each nonprofit spends their money, as well as details on an individual level detailing personal goals and donations.   Ultimately, our objective is to create a system that makes it easier to hold nonprofits accountable and makes it easier for donors to see how their donations are being put to use, as well as providing relevant information on the legitimacy of nonprofits supported on the website. We want to be a central hub of information for all things nonprofit.
