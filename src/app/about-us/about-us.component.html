        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="missionMessage">AltruSightâ€™s goal is to implement a proof-of concept
             website to serve as a beacon of transparency when it
             comes to donating money to nonprofits. There are several 
             main goals for our project. First, we want to provide a 
             centralized system where donors can track how their 
             donations are being used. We also wish to add a social 
             aspect of donation in the form of a Venmo-esque payment 
             feed, as well as the ability to favorite, share, like, 
             etc. for any nonprofit supported on the website. We also
             wish to ultimately provide a comprehensive analytics 
             platform detailing how each nonprofit spends their money, 
             as well as details on an individual level detailing personal 
             goals and donations. </p>
             
        <p class="missionMessage">Ultimately, our objective is to create 
             a system that makes it easier to hold nonprofits accountable 
             and makes it easier for donors to see how their donations are 
             being put to use, as well as providing relevant information 
             on the legitimacy of nonprofits supported on the website. We 
             want to be a central hub of information for all things 
             nonprofit.</p>
